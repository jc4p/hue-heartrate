# hue-heartrate
WatchOS2 app for jc4p/red-alert

This is a really dumb WatchOS app that lets you start a custom workout (which in turn kicks the heartrate sensor into always-on mode), and stream heart rate measurements to a web service.

I'm using it for [jc4p/red-alert](https://github.com/jc4p/red-alert)
